# 1. import any required library to load dataset, open files (os), print confusion matrix and accuracy score


# 2. Reuse your extract_features function here for euron-spam dataset


# 3. Create test set if you like to do the 60:40 split programmatically or if you have not already split the data at this point


# 4. Load your saved model for euron-spam that you saved in classifier_euron.py via Pikcle


# 5. Make predictions on test_matrix create from step 3


# 6. use predictions and test_matrix classifications to print confution matrix and accuracy score
